    <b>If you want to make a folder as a repo of your github then you need to do what?</b><br>
    Initialize Git:
        git init<br>
    Add Files to the Repository:
        git commit -m "Initial commit"<br>
    Create a Repository on GitHub<br>
    Link Your Local Repository to GitHub<br>
    Push Your Repository to GitHub<br>
    Verify on GitHub<br>
    <br>

    <b>Why git is fast in executing the commands typed?</b><br>
    The reason of fast execution is that it is developed in C language<br>

    <br>



    <b>To track the file what is the commands?</b><br>
    git add <filename> <br>
    <br>
  
    <b>Why the title tag appears in the body part of the html structure?</b><br>
    The title tag appears in the body when inspecting because the 
    browser encounters visible content like h1 first, 
    causing it to start rendering the body implicitly before
    processing the title.
    <br>
    <b>Why git is not showing git commit command while adding a file and it is showing command for unstage ?
    </b><br>
    git is not showing git commit command while adding a file and it is showing command for unstage because 
    files are already staged and ready for a commit.<br>
    <br>

    <b> What is the difference before first push and after first push ?</b><br>
    before first push there is no link between local and remote repository but
     after first push there will be link between local and remote repository.<br>
    <br>
    
    <b> How the title tag is fetched to head and h1 is fetched to body when rendering a HTML file which has no structure ?</b><br>
    When rendering an HTML file with no structure, the browser automatically 
    places the title tag into the head and the h1 tag into the body based on HTML parsing rules and defaults.
    <br>
    <br> 

    <b>What is the difference between href and src and why it is used in img and anchor tag ?</b><br>
    href is used with anchor tag as it is used to redirect 
    to external link while src tag is used with img as it is
     used to embed a content inside the webpage.
    <br>
    <br> 

    <b>Why there is three dots in if...else and do...while ?
    </b><br>The three dots (...) in if...else and
     do...while in documentation or examples are 
     placeholders used to indicate omitted code or logic. 
     They imply that additional statements or code blocks 
     should be added in those places.

    <br>
    <br> 

    <b>What is the difference between spread and rest operator ?
    </b><br>
    The spread operator (...) expands an array or object, while 
    the rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an 
    array or parameters and used as function parameter.
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <b>Why Components should start with Capital letter?</b><br>
    Differentiation: React treats lowercase tags 
    as HTML elements and uppercase tags 
     as custom components.<br>
     <br>

     <b>While exporting a component why default keyword is mandatory?</b>
     <br>
     The default keyword is not mandatory when exporting a component, but 
     it simplifies imports by allowing you to import the component without 
     curly braces, as each file can have only one default export. Itâ€™s 
     typically used when a file exports a single primary component, making imports 
     more convenient. However, if you want to export multiple components or functions 
     from a file, you should use named exports, which require curly braces during import.
      The choice between default and named exports depends on your use case and whether you
       prioritize simplicity or clarity in your code structure.<br>
       <br>
       <li>What is use of StrictMode in main.jsx</li>
        <p>React's StrictMode is used to highlight potential problems in an application by enabling additional checks and warnings for its child components during development.
            It helps developers write better, more resilient code by detecting unsafe lifecycle methods, legacy API usage, and unexpected side effects.</p>

        <p></p>
        <li>What is Linting error?</li>
        <p>A linting error is a code issue identified by a linter tool that flags deviations from coding standards, style guidelines, or best practices. It helps improve code quality, readability, and prevents potential bugs.</p>
